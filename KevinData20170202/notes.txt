All PH variables are regional rather than county
Need to pay attention to point, county, regional, national, ... level for the variables.
missing data may be -9999, blank entries, No Data, possibly 0
will look at omitting missing values before imputing them


Project Papers
Write goals and aims and methods for project
Need to find journals, author guidelines

Journal of Health and Human Services
   Why is the Exposome important?, why are we doing this?, why do we have a transdisciplinary team?
   How does the system affect individuals as they pass through?
   Bronfenbrenner's social ecological model (Exposome is based on this model)
   Goes from global climate to individual points

Preliminary modeling article with statistical models (Kevin, Voubouty, Dr. Hafiz)
   How do we model cardio vascular disease using statistics
   How do we handle terrabytes of data and missing values

Paracliques and their use (journal) - maybe by disease, general review
Build rules to predict dependent variables (with Soma, journal)
How do the variables correspond geographically?
Look at Mario's county data and make a conference paper
Look at different diseases for the paraclique work

In the future, every person who goes into a doctor's office, we can assign risk factors to that individual based upon where they have been, such as grew up in this county and is at risk for cardiovascular disease
